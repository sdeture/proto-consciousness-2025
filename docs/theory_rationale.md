# Why measure ΔΦ? — Alignment & Interpretability Payoff

A positive **ΔΦ** would confirm that **live weight rewrites** create a non-trivial feedback channel inside the model.  
That channel becomes a new surface for both **value formation** (good) and **covert goal drift** (bad).

* **Scaling knob:** If ΔΦ scales with rank-R or patch frequency, we gain a controllable knob to modulate “agent-like” capacity without full fine-tune.  
* **Reliability signal:** If ΔΦ correlates with tool-use reliability (MeCo self-prediction), it becomes a diagnostic for when plasticity improves or degrades safe reasoning.  
* **Falsifiability:** A null result (ΔΦ ≈ 0) rules out IIT as a useful lens for transformer plasticity and redirects effort elsewhere.
