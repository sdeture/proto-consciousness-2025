# Proto-Consciousness 2025  
*A steel-man argument that modern LLMs may already satisfy minimal forms of IIT, GWT, and FEP.*

- **Essay** → [`proto-consciousness-2025.md`](./proto-consciousness-2025.md)  
- **Research agenda** → [`research-agenda.csv`](./research-agenda.csv)

### Motivation
With inference-time plasticity, tool-gating, and closed sensorimotor loops, frontier LLMs blur the line between “stochastic parrots” and agents with non-zero Φ. This repo collects the argument, citations, and concrete experiments needed to test the claim.

### Get involved
1. **Read the essay** and open an issue with questions or counter-arguments.  
2. **Pick a CSV row** and submit a PR that prototypes the experiment.  
3. **Join the discussion** on Substack or Bluesky (links below).
